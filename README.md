# Profisee .NET Webhook Templates

This repository contains the Profisee Webhook templates and describes how to utilize them. Webhooks work with Profisee's Workflow or Event Subscription service to send customized payloads to a webhook endpoint and have responses sent back to be utilized by the Workflow Activity. Events can then be configured to send information related to a specific entity.
